Jelly arrived at EMF. All components present. RTC reset itself - replaced battery and seems OK, but 
not impressed with tese RTC units - very temperamental.

Physical assembly OK with people standing on the top box. Futsing about when bottle fell out and 
broke pump - argh! Taped pump from ALDI santizer bottled - works, but dispenser straw doesn't govery 
deep into bottle - will run out quickly... Still it works.

Volume is lower than test for two reasons:

1. Outside.
2. Battery padding for transit by sack trolley.

Still, it's enough - just not as obnoxious as might have been... actually might be better this way.

Ratchet strapped to sack trolley... very heavy - a little worried about budget sack trolley surviving.
Decided to move to South loos to reduce transit distance, and site seems fine in light of lower volume.

Installed, but cannot connect - think power must have come out... Returned and USB power had dislogded
in transit. Replaced - working perfectly. :-)

Much hilarity. Sideshow made an evil genius suggestion... fill with Ketchup, but also add a label 
saying "Ketchup" so people only have themselves to blame for not reading it. No Sideshow, No.
