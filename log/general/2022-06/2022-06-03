Reflections.

It's working really well. Volume level is good - loud enought to surprise, but not apparently enough
to generate many complaints - at least not that have gotten back to us.  Bluetooth distance is really
good.

Usage is very variable... when it runs out of sanitizer, people really hammer on the pump to try to 
get some, and so it goes off a lot more often when empty.
