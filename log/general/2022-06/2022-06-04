This morning was not working. Assumed electroncs battery dead from high relay use, so went to retrieve
control package.  Dismayed to see the Arduino wtill powered. Turns out RTC had reset. Not sure why. 
It had rained overnight, so moisture might have been an issue, although the waterproofing bag seems to
to be working well enough.

Noticed a lot of sanitizer oozing down back of MDF panel - cheap pumps are a bit messy. Probably better
that it oozes down than fills button compartment.  Should clean off through - don't want vapour build-up
inside box with DC brushed motor activating.

Added CoolOffSetting, and code to update / use it. Reason is so that when it's empty, and people are 
pressing the pump many times to try to get something out of it, it doesn't keep going off too much.
Can set remotely with COOL##, up to 600 seconds.

This will reset the stats because EEPROM MagicSetting will change location, so here's record of where 
we're at (includes testing use, but that wasn't very much - about 30 activations):

button      5417
timehit     2832
hits        722
manual      54
